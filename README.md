Currently working on determining gender of unsubscribed customers. 
To make reccomendation of where to put the 2 new bike stations, we must look at latitude longitude patterns and trends between male and female
Our idea: Make a graph using stations as nodes, weight the graph based on frequency (how many people make journeys between those two nodes). Find where to put additional nodes
